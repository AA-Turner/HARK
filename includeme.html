<p>Welcome to HARK!  We are tremendously excited you&#8217;re here.  HARK is
very much a work in progress, but we hope you find it valuable.  We
<em>really</em> hope you find it so valuable that you decide to contribute
to it yourself.  This document will tell you how to get HARK up and
running on your machine, and what you will find in HARK once you do.</p>
<p>If you have any comments on the code or documentation, we&#8217;d love to
hear from you!  Our email addresses are:</p>

<li>QUICK START GUIDE</li>
</ol>
<p>This is going to be easy, friend.  HARK is written in Python, specifically the
Anaconda distribution of Python.  Follow these easy steps to get HARK going:</p>
<p>1) Go to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a> and download Anaconda for your
operating system; be sure to get the version for Python 2.7</p>
<p>2) Install Anaconda, using the instructions provided on that page.  Now you have
installed everything you need to run most of HARK.  But you still need to get HARK
on your machine.</p>
<p>3) To get HARK on your machine, you should know that HARK is managed with version
control software called &#8220;Git&#8221;.  HARK is hosted on a website called &#8220;GitHub&#8221; devoted
to hosting projects managed with Git.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to know more than that, you don&#8217;t have to. Go to HARK&#8217;s page
on GitHub (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK">https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK</a>), click the &#8220;Clone or download&#8221;
in the upper right hand corner of the page, then click &#8220;Download ZIP&#8221;. Unzip it
into an empty directory. Maybe call that directory /HARK ?  The choice is yours.</p>
<p>You can also clone HARK off GitHub using Git.  This is slightly more difficult,
because it involves installing Git on your machine and learning a little about
how to use Git.  We believe this is an investment worth making, but it is up to you.
To learn more about Git, read the documentation at <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/documentation">https://git-scm.com/documentation</a>
or visit many other great Git resources on the internet.</p>
<p>4) Open Spyder, an interactive development environment (IDE) for Python
(specifically, iPython).  On Windows, open a command prompt and type &#8220;spyder&#8221;.
On Linux, open the command line and type &#8220;spyder&#8221;.  On Mac, open the command
line and type &#8220;spyder&#8221;.</p>
<p>5) Navigate to the directory where you put the HARK files.  This can be done
within Spyder by doing &#8220;import os&#8221; and then using os.chdir() to change directories.
chdir works just like cd at a command prompt on most operating systems, except that
it takes a string as input: os.chdir(&#8216;Music&#8217;) moves to the Music subdirectory
of the current working directory.</p>
<p>6) Run one of HARK&#8217;s modules.  You can either type &#8220;run MODULENAME&#8221; after navigating
to the correct directory (see set 5), or click the green arrow &#8220;run&#8221; button in
Spyder&#8217;s toolbar after opening the module in the editor.  Every module should
do <em>something</em> when run, but that something might not be very interesting in
some cases.  For starters, check out /ConsumptionSavingModel/ConsIndShockModel.py
See section III below for a full list of modules that produce non-trivial output.</p>
<p>7) The Python environment can be cleared or reset with ctrl+.  Note that
this will also change the current working directory back to its default.
To change the default directory (the &#8220;global working directory&#8221;), see
Tools&#8211;&gt;Preferences&#8211;&gt;Global working directory; you might need to restart
Spyder for the change to take effect.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li>Read the more complete documentation in HARKmanual.pdf.</li>
</ol>
<p>9) OPTIONAL: If you want to use HARK&#8217;s multithreading capabilities, you will
need two Python packages that do not come automatically with Anaconda: joblib
and dill.  Assuming you have the necessary permissions on your machine, the
easiest way to do this is through Anaconda.  Go to the command line, and type
&#8220;conda install joblib&#8221; and then &#8220;conda install dill&#8221; (accept defaults if prompted).
If this doesn&#8217;t work, but you have Git, you can just clone the packages directly
off GitHub.  Go to the command line and navigate to the directory you want to put
these packages in.  Then type &#8220;git clone <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joblib/joblib.git">https://github.com/joblib/joblib.git</a>&#8221;
and then &#8220;git clone <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill">https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill</a>&#8221;.  Joblib should work
after this, but there is one more step to get dill working.  Navigate to dill&#8217;s
directory in the command line, and then type &#8220;python setup.py build&#8221;.  Then you
should have joblib and dill working on your machine.</p>
<p>Note: If you did not put joblib and dill in one of the paths in sys.path, you will
need to add the joblib and dill directories to sys.path.  The easiest way to do this
is to open up Anaconda, and type:</p>
<p>import sys
sys.path.append(&#8216;path_to_joblib_directory&#8217;)
sys.path.append(&#8216;path_to_dill_directory&#8217;)</p>

<p>Model modules:
- ConsumptionSavingModel/TractableBufferStockModel.py</p>
<blockquote>
<div>A &#8220;tractable&#8221; model of consumption and saving in which agents face one
simple risk with constant probability: that they will become permanently
unemployed and receive no further income.  Unlike other models in HARK,
this one is not solved by iterating on a sequence of one period problems.
Instead, it uses a &#8220;backshooting&#8221; routine that has been shoehorned into
the AgentType.solve framework.  Solves an example of the model when run,
then solves the same model again using MarkovConsumerType.</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>ConsumptionSavingModel/ConsIndShockModel.py</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">Consumption-saving models with idiosyncratic shocks to income.  Shocks
are fully transitory or fully permanent.  Solves perfect foresight model,
a model with idiosyncratic income shocks, and a model with idiosyncratic
income shocks and a different interest rate on borrowing vs saving.  When
run, solves several examples of these models, including a standard infinite
horizon problem, a ten period lifecycle model, a four period &#8220;cyclical&#8221;
model, and versions with perfect foresight and &#8220;kinked R&#8221;.</p>
</dd>

<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>ConsumptionSavingModel/ConsPrefShockModel.py</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">Consumption-saving models with idiosyncratic shocks to income and multi-
plicative shocks to utility.  Currently only has one model, extending
the &#8220;kinked R&#8221; model.  When run, solves an example of the preference shock
model with different interest rates on borrowing and saving.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>ConsumptionSavingModel/ConsMarkovModel.py</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">Consumption-saving models with a discrete state that evolves according to
a Markov rule.  Discrete states can vary by their income distribution,
interest factor, and/or expected permanent income growth rate.  When run,
solves four example models: (1) A serially correlated unemployment model
with boom and bust cycles (4 states). (2) An &#8220;unemployment immunity&#8221; model
in which the consumer occasionally learns that he is immune to unemployment
shocks for the next N periods.  (3) A model with a time-varying permanent
income growth rate that is serially correlated.  (4) A model with a time-
varying interest factor that is serially correlated.</p>

</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>ConsumptionSavingModel/ConsAggShockModel.py</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">Consumption-saving models with idiosyncratic and aggregate income shocks.
Currently has a micro model with a basic solver (linear spline consumption
function only, no value function), and a Cobb-Douglas economy for the
agents to &#8220;live&#8221; in (as a &#8220;macroeconomy&#8221;).  When run, solves an example of
the micro model in partial equilibrium, then solves the general equilibrium
problem to find an evolution rule for the capital-to-labor ratio that is
justified by consumers&#8217; collective actions.</p>

</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>FashionVictim/FashionVictimModel.py</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">A very serious model about choosing to dress as a jock or a punk.  Used to
demonstrate micro and macro framework concepts from HARKcore.  It might be
the simplest model possible for this purpose, or close to it.  When run,
the module solves the microeconomic problem of a &#8220;fashion victim&#8221; for an
example parameter set, then solves the general equilibrium model for an
entire &#8220;fashion market&#8221; constituting many types of agents, finding a rule
for the evolution of the style distribution in the population that is justi-
fied by fashion victims&#8217; collective actions.</p>
