\opening{Dear Daron,}

The attached paper is a descendant of a paper that I submitted to {\it
  Econometrica} a long time ago.  (I say `descendant' rather than
`revision' because the changes are so extensive and the results so
much stronger).  I've never done such a thing before (gone back to the
same journal), but enough people have told me that this paper should
be in {\it Econometrica} that I've decided to risk it.
Though I am deeply sympathetic to {\it Econometrica}'s recent move
away from theory and toward measurement, my hope is that the theoretical tools
developed here will help form the core of the tools used in many future
measurement papers.  

\closing{Sincerely,}

\ps{P.S.\  The paper as submitted is surely too long for publication in
  full; I anticipate that most of the appendix material should be
  available as an online supplement rather than published in its
  entirety.}
