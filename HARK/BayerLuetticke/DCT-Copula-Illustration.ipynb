    "#### Intuitively, how does the reduction work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step is to find an efficient \"compressed\" representation of the function (e.g., the consumption function).  The analogy to image compression is that nearby pixels are likely to have identical or very similar colors, so we need only to find an efficient way to represent the way in which the colors change from one pixel to another.  Similarly, consumption at a given point is likely to be close to consumption at a nearby point, so a function that captures that similarity efficiently can preserve most of the information without keeping all of the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be using the discrete consine transformation (DCT), which is commonly used in image compression. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform) for the Wikipedia page on DCT. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The other tool we use is the \"copula,\" which allows us to represent the distribution of people across idiosyncratic states efficiently\n",
    "   * The crucial assumption behind the copula is that what aggregate shocks do is to squeeze or distort the steady state distribution, but leave the rank structure of the distribution the same. Think of representing a balloon by a set of points on its surface; the copula assumption is effectively that when something happens to the balloon (more air is put in it, or it is squeezed on one side, say), we can represent what happens by thinking about how the relationship between points is distorted, rather than having to reconstruct the shape of the balloon with a completely independent set of new points.  Which points are close to which other points does not change, but the distances between them can change.  If the distances between them change in a particularly simple way, you can represent what has happened with a small amount of information.  For example, if the balloon is perfectly spherical, then adding a given amount of air might increase the distances between adjacent points by 5 percent.  (See the video illustration here)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of this model, the assumption is that the rank order correlation (e.g. the correlation of where you are in the distribution of liquid assets and illiquid assets) remains the same after the aggregate shocks are introduced to StE\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this case we just need to represent how the marginal distributions of each state change, instead of the full joint distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This reduces 3600 $\\times$ 3 to 30+30+4=64. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory)) for the Wikipedia page on copula.\n",
