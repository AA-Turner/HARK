# Summary statistics of wealth and permanent income in the United States

# TODO

The summary statistics in `WealthIncomeStats.csv` are computed using the
Survey of Consumer Finances. The file can be replicated directly from the
unprocessed SCF summary files using the repository [SCF-IncWealthDist](https://github.com/Mv77/SCF-IncWealthDist),
created by [Mateo Velasquez-Giraldo](https://mv77.github.io/).
