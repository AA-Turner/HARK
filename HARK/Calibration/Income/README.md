This folder contains various tools that are used for replicating calibrations/estimates of income processes from the literature.

## `SabelhausSongProfiles.py`

This file contains tools for producing life-cycle profiles of the volatilities of transitory and permanent shocks to income using the results from [Sabelhaus & Song (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393210000358).

The estimates used to reproduce the results from the paper were generously provided by [John Sabelhaus](https://www.sites.google.com/view/johnsabelhaus).
