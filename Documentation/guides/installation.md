# HARK installation guide

This guide provides a brief overview of how to install HARK on your computer.

If you're looking to contribute to HARK itself,
see the [contributor's guide].

## Set up Python

In order to use HARK, you firstly need to download and add [Python 3] to the PATH.
If you are not confident about the installation process,
you can use this [step-by-step guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

If you do not already have a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE)
for Python, we recommend [PyCharm] or [Visual Studio Code].

## Install HARK

After installing Python and the text editor, you can install HARK package.
The simplest way is to use [conda].

1. We first set up a Conda 'environment' for HARK. 
   This is a way of isolating the installation of HARK so that it does not interfere
   with any other Python scripts or modules on your computer.
   To do so, at a command line type:

   ```console
   $ conda create -n econ-ark
   ```

2. Activate the environment:

   ```console
   $ conda activate econ-ark
   ```

3. Install HARK into the environment:

   ```console
   (econ-ark) $ conda install econ-ark
   ```

## Run your script

Every time you run an Econ-ARK script,
you need to activate the environment first, as described above.

Then, you can run your script from the command line:

```console
cd [directory where you located your script]
python your_script.py
```

## Content Aside from the Toolkit

If you don't already have one, you should designate a place on your computer
where you will be putting all the Econ-ARK content.
For example, you could create an `econ-ark` folder within your home directory.

### Demonstrations And Illustrations

Most of the modules in HARK are just collections of tools.
To look at a demonstrations, see the [DemARK] and [REMARK] repositories.

You will want to obtain your own local copy of these repositories using:

```console
git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/DemARK
git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK
```

Once downloaded, you will find that the repo contains a `notebooks` directory
that contains a number of [jupyter notebooks].
If you have the jupyter notebook tool installed (`conda install jupyter`),
you should be able to launch the jupyter notebook app from the command line with the command:

```console
jupyter notebook
```

### [REMARK]: Replications and Examples Made Using the ARK

To explore the [REMARK]s, enter the `REMARK` directory that contains the cloned
repository from the step above. The root level is mostly descriptive.

The main content is in the `REMARKs` subdirectory,
so `cd REMARKs` to  have a look at what is there.
Each REMARK is contained in a directory with the handle of the REMARK;
for example, `BufferStockTheory` is the handle for the REMARK on
'*The Theoretical Foundations of Buffer Stock Saving*'.

At the top level of the directory for each REMARK we have some meta-information
(title, authors, etc) and an eponymous Jupyter notebook,  e.g. `BufferStockTheory.ipynb.`
In most cases there will also be a subdirectory, e.g. `BufferStockTheory`
which is a placeholder for the substantive content of the project (like, the original paper).

Until a REMARK is finalized and frozen, the original content is often kept somewhere else,
e.g. in an author's GitHub repo.
In this case, the REMARK repo uses a `submodule` version,
which is sort of like a link to the original material.
To save space, a regular 'clone' of the REMARK repo does not incorporate all the submodules;
therefore you may find those folders empty when you first use them.
In order to obtain the **real** content, in the root directory of the repo in question 
(e.g., in `REMARKs/BufferStockTheory`), you need execute the command
`git submodule update --recursive --remote`.
