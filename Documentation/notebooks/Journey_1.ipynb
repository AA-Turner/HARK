    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a one of the possible journeys to learn HARK - the python package designed to solve economic models with the heterogeneous agents. As it is a \"journey\", it is not a one big tutorial but a set of the links to the notebooks/other resources which will help you understand the different HARK objects and functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This journey does not require a special skills in programing. However, we propose a few introductions to Python and object oriented programing (OOP), to make you familiar with the basic concepts. Moreover, we assume some knowledge in economic theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have found this journey, you probably have a concept of heterogeneous agent model, but here is a short recap. Think about a basic infinitely lived consumer problem as you know from first-year graduate courses (letting alone the companies and general equilibrium). Using the Bellman equation we can write it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "V(M_t) &=& \\max_{C_t} U(C_t) + \\beta V(M_{t+1}), \\\\\n",
    "& s.t. & \\\\\n",
    "A_t &=& M_t - C_t, \\\\\n",
    "M_{t+1} &=& R (M_{t}-C_{t}) + Y_t, \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\beta <1 $ is a discount factor, $C_t$ is a consumption, $A_t$ - assets, $Y_t$ - income and $U(C)$ is a standard CRRA utility function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(C)=\\frac{C^{1-\\rho}}{1-\\rho}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume that every consumer faces some uncertainty concerning hers income (eg. it follows AR(1) process), which is idiosyncratic - the realizations of each shock is (potentially) different for each agent. In this setting the bellman equation looks like:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "V(M_t, Y_t) &=& \\max_{C_t} U(C_t) + E\\[\\beta V(M_{t+1}, Y_{t+1})\\], \\\\\n",
    "& s.t. & \\\\\n",
    "A_t &=& M_t - C_t, \\\\\n",
    "M_{t+1} &=& R (M_{t}-C_{t}) + Y_t, \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore finding a distribution of agent assets (consumption, savings) involves many much more sophisticated numerical tools than in case of a representative agent. Obviously, this methods are much more demanding to master. Moreover, the knowledge about this numerical methods is much less structuralized, and often hard to find, as it is mentioned in the HARK manual:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"After months of effort, you may have had the character-improving experience of\n",
    "proudly explaining to your adviser that not only had you grafted two ideas\n",
    "together, you also found a trick that speeded the solution by an order of\n",
    "magnitude, only to be told that your breathtaking insight had been understood\n",
    "for many years, as reflected in an appendix to a 2008 paper; or, worse, your\n",
    "discovery was something that “everybody knows” but did not exist at all in\n",
    "published form!\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HARK was designed to help you avoid the similar experiences. Firstly, it enables you to use the standard heterogeneous agents models in your research, not pushing you to understand all the numerical ideas. Moreover, if you want to solve a not-standard model, HARK enables you to create your solution building-on the already implemented algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it requires some time to comprehend the main classes and functionalities. We hope that this journey will make this easier! Additionally, at the final sections of the journey, we give you some guidance about the code structure and the numerical methods, what will be helpful if (one day) you decided to solve your own, completely not - standard, fancy model.        \n"

    "# Few words about HARK structure\n",
    "\n",
    "HARK was written using OOP (we hope that you skimmed the tutorials and have some understanding of this). This means that different parts of the model, like different type of consumers', firms, general equilibrium (if you have this components in the model) are implemented as different objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such structure enables you to build your own models with different consumer types distributions / companies structure (if you want some)... . Importantly, learning the package with a such structure imply learning the different types of objects (classes). In HARK there are two main classes: **Agent-type** (think consumers, microeconomic models) and **Market** (think general equilibrium, macro models). As Agent-type objects are the attributes of Market, we firstly present you this type (additionally, if you are interested in more microeconomic research, the market class may not be interesting for you). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, only two classes will not be enough to accommodate the huge variety of the currently used models. Thus, each of the classes have subclasses and they have their own subclasses... In general more sophisticated class is a subclass. This journey will reflect this structure, by showing you first the most primitive models, then proceed to the more fancy ones.\n"
