As $m_{t}$ approaches
$-\ushort{m}_{t}$, $\Lo{\koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})$ converges to zero, while as $m_{t}$
approaches $+\infty$, $\Lo{\koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})$ approaches $1$.

As before (in equation \eqref{eq:vEndtdefn}), we can derive an approximated consumption function; call it
$\Alt{\Lo{\cFunc}}_{t}$.  This function will clearly do a better job approximating the consumption
function for low values of $\mRat_{t}$ while the previous approximation will perform better
for high values of $\mRat_{t}$.

For middling values of $\mRat$ it is not clear which of these
functions will perform better.  However, an alternative is available
which performs well.  Define the highest gridpoint below $\mtCusp$ as
$\bar{\check{\mRat}}_{t}^{\#}$ and the lowest gridpoint above $\mtCusp$ as
$\ushort{\hat{\mRat}}_{t}^{\#}$.  Then there will be a unique interpolating
polynomial that matches the level and slope of the consumption function
at these two points.  Call this function $\tilde{\cFunc}_{t}(\mRat)$.

Using indicator functions that are zero everywhere except for specified intervals,
