As a preliminary to our solution, define $\hEnd_{t}$ as
end-of-period human wealth (the present discounted value
of future labor income) for a perfect foresight version of the problem
of a `risk optimist:' a consumer who believes with perfect confidence
that the shocks will always take the value
\pShkOn
{1, $\tShkEmp_{t+n} = \Ex[\tShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$ and $\pShk_{t+n} = \Ex[\pShk]=1~\forall~n>0$.}
{1, $\tShkEmp_{t+n} = \Ex[\tShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$.}
The solution to a perfect foresight problem of this kind takes the
form\footnote{For a derivation, see \cite{BufferStockTheory}; $\MinMPC_{t}$ is defined therein as the MPC of the perfect foresight consumer with horizon $T-t$.}
